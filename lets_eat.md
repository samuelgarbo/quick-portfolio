## Let's eat app

**Project description:** Cooking has always been close to me so I wanted to make a project related to that. "Let's cook" app is a full stack recipe application built with the MERN stack. Some functionalities are creating an account, searching for recipes and reviewing them.

For recipe data the project utilizes Edamam's recipe API. The front-end was done with React and Material UI and the back-end was built on Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. Authorization was done with JWT.

The project was a great opportunity to learn how the front and back-end communicate and how to handle and display data in React.
